As Singaporeâ€™s oldest commercial district, it is without a doubt that Raffles Place has witnessed some of the biggest changes on the island. Known as Commercial Square until 1858, Raffles Place was demarcated by Sir Stamford Raffles as a space for commercial activities. This area, however, was swampy and had to be reclaimed. A hill was levelled for the commercial space and the earth was in turn used to fill in the swampy ground to form Boat Quay. Indian convicts were used to fill in the swamps and laid out plots for building purposes. As Singapore developed, this area eventually became the commercial heart of the city. Big Asian and European shops, offices and godowns adjoined one another, living and trading side-by-side.
