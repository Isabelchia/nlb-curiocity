As Singaporeâ€™s oldest commercial district, Raffles Place has witnessed some of the biggest changes on the island. Known as Commercial Square until 1858, Raffles Place was demarcated by Sir Stamford Raffles as a space for commercial activities in 1828. Since then, this piece of land has evolved from a swampland to the commercial heart of Singapore.
