The former Fullerton Building was one of the most important landmarks in the Civic District. The building is located at 1 Fullerton Square in the Downtown Core of the Central Region. It sits partially on the site of the former Fort Fullerton. After Fort Fullerton was demolished, the site was occupied by the Post Office and the Exchange Building until around 1922, when both buildings were demolished to make way for the Fullerton Building, which was completed in mid-1928. The building housed the General Post Office and, over the years, other government offices including the Inland Revenue Department.
