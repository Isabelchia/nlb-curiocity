Kallang Basin is an enclosed bay where the Kallang River, Rochor River and Geylang River empty into. The basin along with a Bugis village were depicted as early as 1836 in G. D. Colemanâ€™s *Map of the Town and Environs of Singapore*. In the early days, Bugis traders would unload cargoes from their sail boats the basin. Thereafter, the banks would be lined with sawmills, oil and rice mills, abattoirs, engineering workshops and factories lined the banks of Kallang River. Today, the Kallang Basin forms part of the Marina Reservoir and is a popular location for water sports.
