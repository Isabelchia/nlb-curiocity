Chinatown is an estate located largely in the [Outram](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_733_2005-01-25.html) area in the Central Region of Singapore. In his 1822 master [Town Plan](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_658_2005-01-07.html), [Sir Stamford Raffles](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_715_2004-12-15.html) allocated the whole area west of the [Singapore River](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_148_2005-02-02.html) for a Chinese settlement known as the Chinese Campong (kampong in Malay means “village”), envisaging the Chinese people to form the bulk of future town dwellers. Singapore, the new land of opportunity then, had attracted many immigrants from China, who expanded the original boundaries of this economically and culturally vibrant, self-contained town. Today, Chinatown is Singapore’s largest Historic District, and an important and unique ethnic quarter Singaporeans fondly call “our Chinatown”.
