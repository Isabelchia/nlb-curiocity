Chinatown is an estate located largely in the [Outram](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_733_2005-01-25.html) area in the Central Region of Singapore.[^1] In his 1822 master [Town Plan](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_658_2005-01-07.html), [Sir Stamford Raffles](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_715_2004-12-15.html) allocated the whole area west of the [Singapore River](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_148_2005-02-02.html) for a Chinese settlement known as the Chinese Campong (kampong in Malay means “village”), envisaging the Chinese people to form the bulk of future town dwellers.[^2] Singapore, the new land of opportunity then, had attracted many immigrants from China, who expanded the original boundaries of this economically and culturally vibrant, self-contained town.[^3] Today, Chinatown is Singapore’s largest Historic District, and an important and unique ethnic quarter Singaporeans fondly call “our Chinatown”.[^4]
