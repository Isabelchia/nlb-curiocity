The former site of Raffles Chambers which used to house Robinsons department store is currently occupied by One Raffles Place Place (formerly Overseas Union Bank Centre or OUB Centre). Designed by the award-winning Japanese architect Kenzo Tange and completed in 1987, One Raffles Place has a glass and steel tower made up of two triangular prisms of different heights attached to each other. The tower is etched by a grid pattern of rectangles and window units, and clad with a specially treated aluminium alloy that allows it to change colour with the light it reflects. It rises above a retail podium that features a dramatic entrance with an eight-storey-high cutaway.
