The octagonal-shaped United Overseas Bank (UOB) Plaza is another defining skyscraper of Raffles Place. It was built in 1974 on the site of Bonham Building, UOBâ€™s former headquarters. The building originally comprised a 30-storey office tower and a five-storey podium at the base. In 1988, UOB hired Japanese architect Kenzo Tange to retrofit the tower and to design a plaza as well as a new 66-storey skyscraper next to it. The enlarged development was completed in 1992.
