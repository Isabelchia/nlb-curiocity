The Chartered Bank building of the 1960s was best known for its striking dome shaped roof. Designed by Swan & Maclaren and completed in 1915 on the former site of the Dispensary building, it served as the headquarters of Chartered Bank from Battery Road. In the 1980s, the building replaced a new Chartered Bank Building. Completed in 1984, the new building has not only a 43-storey storey, but also a unique exterior that is clad with brown granite. It was designed by the P&T architect group.
