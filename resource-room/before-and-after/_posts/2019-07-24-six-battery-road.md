Six Battery Road (formerly Chartered Bank Building) was built on the site of the iconic dome-roof Chartered Bank Building during the urban renewal efforts of Raffles Place after independence. Completed in 1984, the 43-storey tower has a unique exterior as it is clad with brown granite. The building was designed by the P&T architect group.
