Since the renaming of Commercial Square as Raffles Place in 1858, Raffles Place had witnessed profound changes. This was marked by the construction of many fine two to four-storey buildings housing mercantile houses, banks and shops. By the time Singapore gained independence in 1965, Raffles Place was a prime location surrounded by some of the finest buildings.
