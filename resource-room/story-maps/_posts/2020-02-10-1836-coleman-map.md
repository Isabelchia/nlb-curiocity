In 1829, George Drumgoole Coleman (G. D. Coleman) was tasked to prepare a topographical survey of Singapore. This 1836 map is the result of the survey and it represents the first comprehensive map that depicts not only the roads and buildings in the town, but also elements in the island's interior and coastal lands such as contours, rivers, and geographical names. As a whole, this map provides us an important perspective on how much Singapore had developed within 25 years of the British arrival.
