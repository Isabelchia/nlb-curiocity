For almost two centuries, Raffles Place has been the designated business centre of Singapore. Located southwest of the mouth of Singapore River, it was originally a hilly area before it was leveled under the 1823 Singapore Town Plan. Prior to 1858, Raffles Place was called Commercial Square, and in the past 50 years, the area has witnessed major transformation when many of its old iconic buildings were replaced by modern skyscrapers.
