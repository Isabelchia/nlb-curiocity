Chinatown is an estate located largely in the [Outram](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_733_2005-01-25.html) area in the Central Region of Singapore.1 In his 1822 master [Town Plan](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_658_2005-01-07.html), [Sir Stamford Raffles](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_715_2004-12-15.html) allocated the whole area west of the [Singapore River](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_148_2005-02-02.html) for a Chinese settlement known as the Chinese Campong (kampong in Malay means “village”), envisaging the Chinese people to form the bulk of future town dwellers.2 Singapore, the new land of opportunity then, had attracted many immigrants from China, who expanded the original boundaries of this economically and culturally vibrant, self-contained town.3 Today, Chinatown is Singapore’s largest Historic District, and an important and unique ethnic quarter Singaporeans fondly call “our Chinatown”.4

### History
Long before the arrival of Raffles in 1819, a small immigrant Chinese population had already settled in Singapore, cultivating [gambier](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_337_2005-01-03.html) and pepper. When Singapore’s free port was established, more Chinese and other immigrants flocked to its shores.5 For easy administration, Raffles separated the various immigrant groups into racial quarters. In his 4 November 1822 letter to the Town Committee (also illustrated in the 1828 Town of Singapore Plan published in London), the area from the “Boat Quay southwest bank of the Singapore River” was designated a Chinese Campong.6 This self-contained kampong or community settlement became the home of many Chinese immigrants, and a transit point for [coolies](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_87_2004-12-15.html) (unskilled labourers) going to Malaya.7 Visiting traders sought temporary accommodation there too.8 By 1824, there were 3,317 settlers, almost one-third of the total population at that time.9 That kampong and Chinese centre grew and eventually became Chinatown.10

### Description
The original kampong was divided into zones, a sector for each Chinese community of the same provincial origin and dialect group.11 Much of Chinatown was carved out to reflect the peoples’ lives back in China, such as long narrow streets with ethnic picturesque shophouses.12

Different trades were confined to specific areas, so each street took on its own identity. From delicacies to death-houses, there were businessmen, traders, craftsmen, hawkers and peddlers to provide all of the peoples’ needs. A familiar sight was the outdoor emporium of hawker stalls jamming the streets with every conceivable item, from cooling tea to imitation antiques. The town was complete.13

### Chinese dialect-group sectors
Soon after settling in Singapore, the people built temples that were not just for worship, but also centres of dialect-group activities, before their respective clan associations were established.14 Traditionally the [Cantonese](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1491_2009-03-25.html) occupied [Temple Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_320_2005-01-11.html) and [Mosque Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_304_2005-01-11.html). The [Hokkiens](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1498_2009-04-09.html) were located in [Telok Ayer Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_656_2004-12-31.html) and [Hokien Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_295_2004-12-15.html), while the [Teochews](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1499_2009-04-09.html) were settled in South Canal Road, Garden Street and Carpenter Street.15

### Growth and developments
Chinatown’s physical development began from 1843, when more land leases and grants for homes and trade were awarded – particularly around [Pagoda Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_321_2005-01-11.html), Almeida Street (today’s [Temple Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_320_2005-01-11.html)), [Smith Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_681_2005-01-25.html), [Trengganu Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_330_2005-01-22.html), [Sago Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_349_2005-01-11.html) and [Sago Lane](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_299_2005-01-11.html). In [John Turnbull Thomson](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_818_2005-01-22.html)’s 1846 map, this ethnic quarter expanded to the area demarcated by Telok Ayer Street, Singapore River, [New Bridge Road](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_310_2004-12-17.html) and Pagoda Street. Developed areas by this time included Upper Macao Street (today’s [Upper Pickering Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_920__2008-10-14.html)), Upper Hokien Street, [Upper Chin Chew Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_307_2004-12-17.html), [Upper Cross Street](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_346_2005-01-26.html) and Mosque Street.16 The great immigrant influx came in the early 20th century, and limited housing resulted in overcrowding.17 People lived in sub-divided rooms called cubicles that created more living space, but were crammed, unhealthy and unsafe.18 Inevitably, slums developed.19

The August 1918 survey by the government’s Housing Commission reported much overcrowding and congestion in Chinatown.20 In the mid-1960s, urban renewal schemes started, and residents were re-housed in resettlement estates.21 Major upgrading of shophouses and new developments took place at the end of 1983, after the street hawkers were housed in Kreta Ayer Complex.22 Contrary to its name, Chinatown was not exclusively Chinese. There were small communities of Indian traders around the junction of [South Bridge Road](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_911_2005-01-19.html) and Upper Cross Street, and Indian temples and Muslim mosques can be found in the area too.23

### Today
Chinatown is Singapore’s largest Historic District and the four sub-districts of Bukit Pasoh, Kreta Ayer, Telok Ayer and [Tanjong Pagar](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_732_2005-01-26.html) were given conservation status in the late 1980s.24 Much of the town has changed, but fortunately, remnants of its colourful past are still present and old traditions have endured. During festivals such as the [Lunar New Year](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_948__2009-01-02.html), there are celebrations and festive shopping.25 Always dressed for the occasion, Chinatown would be colourful, lit up and abuzz with activity, attracting not just the Chinese but other locals as well as tourists.26
