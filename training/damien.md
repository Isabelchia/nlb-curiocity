**Introduction**

 

Located at 9 Jurong Town Hall Road, Jurong Town Hall served as the headquarters of the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC; currently known as JTC Corporation) from 1974 until 2000. The building, which is considered a symbol of the success of the industrialisation programme in Jurong, was gazetted as a national monument in 2015. It continues to play a supporting role in the country’s economic development by serving as a hub for technology companies as well as trade associations.

**Design and Architecture**

 

Jurong Town Hall was designed by local firm Architects Team 3. They were the winners of an architectural design competition held in 1969 to select the design of the building. The intention of Architects Team 3’s design was to achieve a building dignified in form and character, efficient and flexible in space and function. The structure also aimed to position itself as the nucleus of Jurong estate as it sits on an 80-foot-long hill that offers a sweeping panorama of the estate below.

**Construction and Completion**

 

Construction work on Jurong Town Hall started in May 1971. Completed in March 1974, the building was opened by then Minister for Finance Hon Sui Sen on 2 June 1975 as part of the weeklong celebrations commemorating JTC’s seventh anniversary. The S$9-million project was an embodiment of the success of the industrialisation programme in Jurong that began in 1961.

 

Besides preparing sites for industrial activities in Jurong, JTC also oversaw the construction of recreational facilities. Flip the flash cards below to learn some of them.
